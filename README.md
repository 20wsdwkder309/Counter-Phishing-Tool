# Anti-Phishing Tool #

Anti-Phishing tool is a simple python script tool that allows you to flood phishing websites with fake auto-generated email and passwords to the point where their servers crash and or they can't find a real user in the sea of millions of fake accounts generated by this tool. Use at own risk and only at people with malicious intentions.

# How to use #

*  1: Download the [Anti-Phisher.zip](https://github.com/EwyBoy/Anti-Phishing-Tool/archive/master.zip)
*  2: Run the Anti-Phisher Tool, but don't type anything yet. *(Make sure to run the exe inside the default folder it came with)*
*  3: Now find a phisher website. I found one in my e-mail that looks like this:

*  4: Click the link to the phisher website. Even if the websites look totaly legit you can often spot it by their URL.
